 My topic for this lab is about "drugs", starting on 1/1/2022, and on the location parameters of Seattle, the Harlem of NY, and Fairfax County in VA. I have chosen this topic because the recent drug issue, especially Fentanyl, has been such a serious problem that ruins thousands of people's lives. Therefore, I was encouraged to explore how people's search results differ with each location, by examining word clouds produced out of those locations. After scrutinizing each word cloud, I found that the people in Harlem, I realized there was a big chunk of the word "dealer", assuming that they might have been looking for the drug dealer to abuse drugs. Moreover, another big size of the word "test" probably represents people who abuse drugs may find some places to check if they are drug addicts. I think that because that the Harlem is relatively poor and less controlled place than Seattle and Fairfax county and people are more prone to drug abuse. One interesting thing that was different from my expectation was the word clouds of Seattle and Fairfax county. Because these places are well-known for high education, there was a big size of the words "help" and "Co", which I assume there were many people working together to reach out for helping those who are suffering from drug abuse. 
I believe my research can be improved by comparing more places with big drug issue and maybe narrowing down the date parameter
to more recent dates which would be easier to catch changes.
One thing that was different from my expectations is the word chunks "help" and "Co", which I did not realize that there were many people who are looking forward to others that suffer from drug abuse. I felt it was such a desirable action by paying close attention to the issue.
